Since seeing what looked like a new version of Google Glass passing through the FCC six months ago, I've been waiting for some sort of announcement. Well the announcement never arrived and today some documents have reached the end of their temporary confidentiality giving us a look at the mysterious A4R-GG1 device.

Presumably this is targeted at workplaces through the Glass at Work intitiative but it's still strange there has been no public acknowledgment of this device as yet.

Enjoy some pictures showing pogo-pin charging, the camera and screen looking much the same, but a new hinged design with a different method of connecting to a frame.

  The camera is still present on the front.

We can also see what looks like a pogo-pin charging mechanism and the hinge
